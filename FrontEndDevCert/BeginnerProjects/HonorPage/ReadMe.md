## Honor Page

### Purpose

I've been a big fan of Elon Musk and the first project for FreeCodeCamp is to create a Tribute Page. I instead decided to make an honor page of Elon Musk and talk about his major achievements.

### Procedure

I learned a lot about the basics involved with HTML and CSS as well as working with a grid container system in Bootstrap. It was a lot of fun seeing the small changes in the markup and stying having such an impact on the final result.
